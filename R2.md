## Log of Round 2 of #100DaysOfMLCode - Sushrut Tendulkar

### Day 36: October 23, 2019. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:Started reading new post on Advanced Numpy. Learnt about memory blocks of ndarray, data types, casting, indexing ans strides, 


[Tutorial - Advanced Python](https://scipy-lectures.org/advanced/advanced_numpy/index.html#indexing-scheme-strides)<br>

**Thoughts:** Took a gap of four days :-(
