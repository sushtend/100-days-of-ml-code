### Day 19: September 29, 2019. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Tried to learn generators in detail. 

[Tutorial - generators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEn_99daJro)

**Thoughts:**  Generators are slow and this is one of the reasons why we don’t see generators being used as part of data science library in this kind of numerical processing sense. If you’re doing serious machine learning models, it's not actually very viable tool because it is hindered by poor mathematical support in python itself.

### Day 18: September 27, 2019. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt to perform basic SQL operations on SQLite database. 

[Tutorial - SQLite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pd-0G0MigUA)

**Thoughts:**  SQLite is a software library that provides a relational database management system. The lite in SQLite means light weight in terms of setup, database administration, and required resource. It is serverless which means SQLite database is integrated with the application that accesses the database. The applications interact with the SQLite database read and write directly from the database files stored on disk.

### Day 17: September 26, 2019. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Practiced data preprocessing on three datasets. Used Randomforest regressor with MAE metric to compare the techniques to handle missing values ( Dropping vs Imputing). <br>
Performed simple principal components analysis to understand the underlying data structure. Created a 'scree plot' to determine how much variation each principal component captures. Used ‘Mahalanobis distances’  method to identify the outliers.
