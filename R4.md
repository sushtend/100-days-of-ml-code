## Log of Round 4 of #100DaysOfMLCode - Sushrut Tendulkar

### Day 72: April 15, 2020. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Took a break of 3 months as I had to work on another project. For next 30 days, I'll be working on a NLP project. Downloaded Yelp data set and read few reviews from it. I also read through a tutorial on Yelp data set analysis.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good to be back on track for 100days of coding challenge
