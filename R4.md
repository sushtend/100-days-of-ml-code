### Day 74: April 17, 2020. Friday

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Parsed a sample review using `spacy` library
2. Performed text normalization -  Lemmatization, Part of Speech etc
3. Using `displacy` rendered the text

**Thoughts:** Spacy threw error while loading the file. Fixed using [this](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/4577) link

### Day 72: April 15, 2020. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Took a break of 3 months as I had to work on another project. For next 30 days, I'll be working on a NLP project. Downloaded Yelp data set and read few reviews from it. I also read through a tutorial on Yelp data set analysis.
